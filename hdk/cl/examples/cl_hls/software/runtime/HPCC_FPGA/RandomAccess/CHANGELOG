# Changelog

This file contains all changes made to the source code for each release.

## 2.5

#### Changed:
- Renamed all configuration parameters to start with `HPCC_FPGA_RA_`
- Update the host code to use Log2 values as inputs for simplification

#### Added:
- Add support for multiple pseudo random number generators specified over `HPCC_FPGA_RA_RNG_COUNT_LOG`
- Modify the number of steps in the shift register between the RNGs with `HPCC_FPGA_RA_RNG_DISTANCE`


## 2.4

#### Changed:
- Make pragma ivdep optional for Intel devices using the new flag `INTEL_USE_PRAGMA_IVDEP`

## 2.3

#### Added:
- Add MPI support for global execution

## 2.2

#### Added:
- Base implementation tests are now build and linked with the unit test binary
- Support for custom kernel designs

## 2.1

#### Added:
- Support for Intel HBM using the USE_HBM flag. This will use the CL_MEM_HETEROGENEOUS_INTELFPGA flag to allocate OpenCL buffers.

## 2.0.3

#### Changed:
- Converted host code to new OO code

## 2.0.2.1

##### Added:
- Host side support for SVM

## 2.0.2

#### Changed:
- OpenMP pragmas from single to master with explicit barriers

## 2.0.1

#### Added:
- Unit tests for result validation and kernel execution
- Add new boolean parameter `COMBINE_LOOPS` that allows to combine the address calculation and loading of the data into a single loop instead of two separate loops. This can improve the performance if the loops are executed sequentially because the outer loop can not be pipelined.

## 2.0

#### Added:
- Replace Makefile with CMake as a build system
